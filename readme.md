Ukraine ransomware hack

this hack was originally developed by the NSA cyberspies called eternalBlue it used a weakness in the auto update system to upload malware rather than update the software. this was unsusal as the system is usually very tightly guarded and once downloaded it would restart the computer then lock it down and ask for payment, for unknown reasons it hit ukraine very hard, 80% of all infected computers were in ukraine and its unknown if this was a politically motivated attack. how it spread so fast and so far is that it is a worm that self replicats over and over hunting for new computers with weaknesses to exploit.
